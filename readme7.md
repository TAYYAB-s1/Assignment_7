# Python Programming Assignment: Number Exploration Tool

## step 1:

we take user name as input

```bash
user = input("enter your name;")
```

## step 2:

taka input of user three favorite number

```bash
num1 = int(input("Enter your first favorite number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter your second favorite number: "))
num3 = int(input("Enter your third favorite number: "))
```

## step 3 :

find weather the given number are even or not

```bash
if num1 % 2 == 0:
  print(f"{num1} is even.")
else:
  print(f"{num1} is odd.")

if num2 % 2 == 0:
  print(f"{num2} is even.")
else:
    print(f"{num2} is odd.")
if num3 % 2 == 0:
  print(f"{num3} is even.")
else:
  print(f"{num3} is odd.")
```

## step 4: calculate square of the given numbers and print number sand their squares

now we will take the sum of the given number and print them

```bash
sum = num1 + num2 + num3
print("the sum of the numbers are:",sum)
```

## step 5: calculate sum of the given numbers

calculate sum of the given numbers and print them

```bash
sum = num1 + num2 + num3
print("the sum of the numbers are:",sum)
```

## step 6:

and we will find weather the sum of the given number is prime or not

```bash
if sum % 2 == 0:
  print(f"wow,{sum} is even number.")
else:
  print(f"wow,{sum} is prime number.")

```
